# Java-Learning-Journey
A personal repository to document my step-by-step learning of Java during my MCA. This repo will include:  

✅ Notes on Java concepts (syntax, OOP, collections, exceptions, etc.)  
✅ Practice problems with solutions  
✅ Mini projects for hands-on learning.

The goal of this repository is to track my progress , improve coding skills, and build a solid foundation in Java. 🚀
